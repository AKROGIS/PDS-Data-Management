You can can merge the necessary dlls into a single exe with ILMerge (a free download from Microsoft or github)

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\ILMerge\ILMerge.exe" /lib:"C:\Program Files (x86)\ArcGIS\DeveloperKit10.5\DotNet" /lib:"C:\Program Files (x86)\ArcGIS\DeveloperKit10.5\bin" /out:verifier.exe "C:\Users\RESarwas\Documents\GitHub\pds-reorg\MapFixer\verifier\bin\Release\verifier.exe" "C:\Users\RESarwas\Documents\GitHub\pds-reorg\MapFixer\MapFixer\bin\Release\MapFixer.dll"

verifier.exe can now be copied to any directory and run standalone.  I have only tested on a machine with ArcObjects .Net SDK installed.
It will probably only work on a machine with the same version of ArcGIS as the development machine.
