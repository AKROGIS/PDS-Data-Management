Bugs
----
 * browser history arrows only update address, not page content (chrome on windows)
 * going from date with data to date without (i.e. 2018-10-04 -> 2018-10-05) does not hide details (chrome on windows)
 * using date arrows when a graph is open does not update the graph (chrome on windows)
 * 2019-02-05 shows no changes on server, not true
